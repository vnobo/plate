# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create a comprehensive QWEN.md file to document the NgWeb Angular project for future interactions, capturing the project's structure, technologies, and development procedures.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Angular 20.3.5 application with zoneless change detection, server-side rendering (SSR), and Tabler UI framework
- **Project Structure**: Modern Angular standalone components, SCSS styling, with both client and server-side configurations
- **Build Commands**: 
  - Development: `npm start` or `ng serve`
  - Production: `npm run build` or `ng build`
